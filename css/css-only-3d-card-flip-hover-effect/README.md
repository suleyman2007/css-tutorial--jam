# css-only-3d-card-flip-hover-effect

##Demo link: (http://www.sureshkaria.com/projects/card-hover/)
This is my first demo on github,  I've found the others over-complicated. Many other tutorials add additional styles to code samples which then require the reader to decipher which are needed and which aren't. This project avoids that issue, providing you only the necessary styles; you can pretty up each side of the flip any way you'd like.
